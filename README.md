# Twilio-project
This project automates WhatsApp message sending using Python, Twilio API, and the Datetime module. It allows users to schedule and send messages at a specific time.

Features:
-Automates WhatsApp message sending
-Allows scheduling messages at a specific time
- Uses Twilio API for message delivery
- Ensures security by hiding credentials

Technologies Used:
-Python – For scripting and automation
-Twilio API – For sending WhatsApp messages
-atetime Module – For scheduling messages
-Environment Variables – To store API credentials securely


Installation & Setup:
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/WhatsApp-Automation-Tool.git
cd WhatsApp-Automation-Tool

2. Install Dependencies
pip install twilio

3. Set Up Twilio API
-Sign up at Twilio
-Get your Account SID and Auth Token
-Set up your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox


4. Important Note:
To run this project, you must add your Twilio credentials (Account SID & Auth Token). I have hidden my credentials using the * key in the project for security reasons. You need to replace them with your own Twilio credentials in the script.

5. Run the Script
python whatsapp_automation.py

How It Works:

1. The script checks the current time.
2. When the scheduled time matches, it sends a message using Twilio API.
3. The Twilio API delivers the message to the recipient’s WhatsApp.

Error Handling & Reliability:
- The project includes error handling mechanisms to catch issues like invalid Twilio credentials, network failures, or incorrect message formats. This ensures smooth execution and prevents crashes.
  
Scalability & Future Enhancements:
-The script is designed to be easily scalable, meaning it can be extended to support multiple recipients, message templates, and even AI-driven automated replies in future updates.
